# myrepo
This is a repo to hold all of my python learner projects.
circus_linux.py is my first script and a fascinating journey into life at the circus.
country_guesser.py makes you guess a random country.
directory.py was my first script to interact with the os.
discordinstall.py is a script to extract, place, and symbololically link .tar.gz discord on Linux.
finalproject.py was a log reader for a python class final.
login.py is a login script that does nothing. Just plaing around with hasing and byte writing.
